# Social Club Client
---
### Planning Story
First the wireframe was made to have an idea, of how the app would look. Following the wireframe the html code was made to match the wireframe
as best as possible. The functionality was made first, using curl was able to communicate with the corresponsing API. Proceeded to create person, profile, and profile update components that would be used while using the app. Tested out CRUD request to make sure the API requests were working. After all the functionality was up and running, the styling of the site was then made.

### App Description
Social Club is an app where you can match with people to get to know, sort of like a tinder. Here you create a profile and will be presented with random people/profiles to like. You would swipe right if you are interested or like a person, or swipe left to skip that person and move on to the next. After you swipe right to like someone, a history of the people you like will be saved on your profile, and in future versions you will be able to message those people.
